Final year project

This is my final year project.
The project is to build an AI-powered ATM system that implements card-less transactions for all.
A QR code will be used for the purpose of authentication, replacing our EMV-chip cards.
A facial recognition system will be responsible to complete the authentication phase.
A neural network will be deployed that will help against face presentation attacks.
Said presentation attack detection system will only be trained for print and static display based FPAs.

GUI - PyQt5
  Database - MySQL

Main files for the project are:
  1. front.py
  2. bnk_options.py
  3. ops_screen.py
  4. wd_scrn.py
  5. bal_scrn.py
  6. bal_lim.py
  7. end_scrn.py
