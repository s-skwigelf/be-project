Final year project

This is my final year project.
The project is to build an AI-powered ATM system that implements card-less transactions for all.
A QR code will be used for the purpose of authentication, replacing our EMV-chip cards.
A facial recognition system will be responsible to complete the authentication phase.
A neural network will be deployed that will help against face presentation attacks.
Said presentation attack detection system will only be trained for print and static display based FPAs.

NOTE :- The dataset for this project is created by me with the help of private subjects, and will not be shared here for the sake of privacy.
